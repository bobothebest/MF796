After more than half a year of studying, I feel that portfolio management and risk management are very intriguing, especially when thinking about using statistical methods, financial knowledge, and algorithms to solve various real-life financial problems, which makes me feel extremely excited.

I really hope that I can understand the underlying logic of financial instruments as thoroughly as possible, which requires a solid foundation and accumulation of mathematical skills. This course introduces how various mathematical concepts are applied in financial pricing, and the assignments allow me to experience how these algorithms can be implemented via computers. It is an extremely practical course that deepens my understanding of finance."

    "- **Gamma** measures the rate of change of an option's delta in relation to the price changes of the underlying asset. Delta itself measures the sensitivity of an option's price to a $1 change in the price of the underlying asset. A high gamma indicates that the delta of an option is highly sensitive to changes in the price of the underlying asset.\n",

    "\n",
    "When option traders say that \"when buying options, we get gamma at the expense of theta,\" they are highlighting a trade-off between the potential for profit from price movements (gamma) and the guaranteed loss over time due to decay (theta). Buying options provides the buyer with positive gamma, which means they benefit from large price swings in the underlying asset. However, this comes with the cost of theta, or time decay, meaning the value of the option decreases as it gets closer to its expiration date, assuming no other variables change.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simpler terms, buying options can be advantageous in volatile markets where the price of the underlying asset moves significantly, as the potential gains from those movements (thanks to gamma) can outweigh the costs of time decay (theta). However, if the market does not move as expected, the time decay will erode the option's value, leading to a loss for the option holder. This is the inherent trade-off between gamma and theta when buying options."

    "### Preferred Method: Midpoint Rule\n",
    "- **Accuracy and Efficiency**: The Midpoint Rule demonstrated significantly better accuracy for a given number of nodes compared to the Left Riemann Rule, as indicated by its lower errors and higher experimental rates of convergence, especially for larger \\(N\\). This improvement in accuracy without a substantial increase in computational effort makes it highly efficient for this application.\n",
    "- **Convergence Rate**: The experimental rates of convergence for the Midpoint Rule approached or exceeded 2 for larger values of \\(N\\), suggesting quadratic convergence under the conditions of our problem. This is particularly advantageous when dealing with smooth functions, as it implies that doubling the number of intervals (and thus the computational effort) can potentially reduce the error by a factor of four.\n",
    "- **Simplicity and Applicability**: While the Gauss-Hermite Quadrature is theoretically more sophisticated and designed for high accuracy in specific cases, its application requires more complex preparation. The Midpoint Rule, on the other hand, is straightforward to implement and does not require such adjustments, making it broadly applicable to a wide range of problems."
